# Introduction
This is a blog website written using Django. Link to the website: http://www.userlist.krzyzan.xyz, be sure to connect using http, some browsers like to force https. The server is running on Apache on a virtual linux server, and it was configured entirerly through a SSH connection. And don't worry, on the real server settings have been changed to be secure. This is how it looks:

# What it does
Nothing. Just kidding, but it doesn't do very much. You can login or register to the website, and it just displays list of all the users. It was a fun little introductory django project, you can make your own account, so everyone can look at it till the end of time (or at least till I take the website down ðŸ¥²).
